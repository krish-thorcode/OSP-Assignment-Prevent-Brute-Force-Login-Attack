# OSP-Assignment-Prevent-Brute-Force-Login-Attack
This assignment was done for ITE1008-Open Source Programming course. The solution has been implemented in PHP.
temp.php - updations are done in this document, after verifying that the changes actually do what they are supposed to, the script is moved to validate.php.
validate_documented.php - documented code.

Note that validate.php, temp.php and validate_documented.php contain the same code.
